A script designed to work alongside [Video Sub Finder](https://sourceforge.net/projects/videosubfinder/).  Video Sub Finder will run over the media file and take images of the screenshots.  The combination of powershell and python can then run the images through Google's Tesseract to extract subtitles.  Any subtitles with unrecognised words will prompt the author for manual editing.
